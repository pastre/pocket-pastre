I ended up, after all, turning it into a mathematical approach into color theory. This is one of my favorite apps becuse I feel like I played my best game in every way: design, maths, app development and color theory. Harmonify is now the app I`m using to learn about business and marketing strategies, since it sort of is a useful tool.", iconName: "harmonify"),
                Milestone(name: ".space", description: ".space is the result of my first mini-challenge at the Academy. Together with friends (Yumi, Barion and Filipe), we provided a tool for people to metaphorically organize their inner space and thoughts, by using abstract shapes, planets, and their orbits ", iconName: "dotspace"),
                
                Milestone(name: "Relibox", description: "This is the product of the second mini-challenge we had at the Academy. My group (Mari, Lari, Jess and Rubens) and I were motivated to link physical objects to digital memories by using NFC tags. It was a great experience for me, since I got to explore UX and UI designing most of the project, and help my friends improve their programming.", iconName: "relibox"),
                
                Milestone(name: "Cube H", description: "This was the last challenge we had at the Academy. My friends (Jota, Maykon and Barion) and I developed a multiplayer idle game focused around the mechanics of a startup. I was the main programmer, so I modeled the game's classes and protocols and implemented it. Maykon and I also trained a CNN model to recognize doodles, which was a pretty fun thing to learn how to do.", iconName: "cubeH"),

It was born as a WWDC entry, where I had my first contact with Apple technologies, 3D scenes, design and Augmented Reality. It was really fun to learn all that stuff, and a real challange to develop it in just 10 days", iconName: "bubbles"),

It is the product of a Crash Course which has the main goal to track time about activities and tasks. I learned about table views, timers, dispatch queue, and tried to design it according to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. It was a nice challenge, but I'm not satisfied with the result.", iconName: "activities"),

                Milestone(name: "Computer Vision", description: "Computer vision is an area that i find to be very intersting. It involves a lot of math applied to images and abstract logic. I integrated a Background Subtraction algorithm, which was developed by a friend, into an architecture that supports multiple image processing algorithms.", iconName: "computerVision"),

I modeled the database, and both modeled and coded the whole backend and frame processing pipeline. It was a really cool challenge, since I got to integrate plenty of awesome algorithms and measure their efficiency and balance their payload on the machine. ", iconName: "systemArchitecture"),
                Milestone(name: "Networking", description: "While working at the same startup, we had the idea of using WiFi to position people in space. Because of that, I learned a lot about networking and the low level WiFi protocol. I also learned a lot about the ESP 8266 and linux.", iconName: "networking"),

I read since I was about 9, and back then would read only adventure-fantasy like books, like Harry Potter and Deltora Quest. By 13, I was way into classics, and devoured Sheakspeare's Hamlet all at once. By 16, I started to dive in some sociology, like Marx, and, by 18, into the deeps of Nietzsche's philosofy. Although I went through some of the biggest in history, like Kant or Plato, it is, now, Nietzsche's nihilistic mindset that catches most of my thoughts. I started only in my late's 22 to read some post-1900 serious books, like Foucault and Paulo Freire.", iconName: "reading"),

It's existence is justified when I get to automate simple home tasks, like turning of lights, and to document it on some vehicle. I'm mostly wiriting Medium articles about this project, so I can better undestand my process of documentation and share with the community my attempts of solving the sometimes common problems we face.", iconName: "autoadventures"),

On the backend, I learned how to develop REST APIs, using Flask and Django, with both SQL (PostgreeSQL) and No-SQL (Firebase Realtime-database) databases. I also learned a lot about Web Scrapping, using BeautifulSoap and Pyppeteer, and learned a lot about networking and how the web works. I also used Flutter for mobile development, and the app was both beautiful on the front-end and consistent on consuming the API. ", iconName: "horariosPUCPR"),
